### **General info:**
This is an implementation of the bayes theorem using python. Feel free to download end edit the code.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Setup:**
*This section will be filled with more useful info soon*.
<br/>
<br/>

### **Complete stuff:**
Starting from a priori probabilities and probability density functions we caclulate total probability density functions, a posteriori probabilities and finally the
bayesian error. The implmentation is done two simulate a real problem. The problem is in what manner two known biological indicators (following gaussian ditribution)
affect the final decision regarding the existence of cancer or not. There are two implementations for different mean values and covariance table of the the biological
indicators (values are within the source code). Lastly, some plots are displayed in order to visualize the results.<br/>
